# Water Cherenkov Detector Simulations

This repository contains structural and thermomechanical simulations designed to evaluate the performance of different geometries for Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs). The project focuses on testing the mechanical stability and resilience of the detectors under varying environmental and structural conditions inspired by the requirements of the Southern Wide-Field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO).

## Project Overview

Water Cherenkov Detectors are critical components for capturing Cherenkov radiation produced by high-energy particles. The performance and longevity of these detectors depend heavily on their structural and thermomechanical integrity. This project aims to:

- Simulate various WCD geometries.
- Analyze their mechanical performance under static and dynamic loads.
- Assess their thermal behavior under realistic environmental conditions.
- Optimize designs to meet the stringent requirements of the SWGO project.

## Features

- **Structural Simulations:** Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of WCD geometries to evaluate mechanical stresses and deformations.
- **Thermomechanical Simulations:** Coupled thermal-structural analysis to study the impact of temperature fluctuations on detector performance.
- **Realistic Conditions:** Simulations are calibrated using environmental and structural parameters relevant to the SWGO project.

## Results

Simulation results include detailed reports on:
- Stress and strain distributions.
- Thermal gradients and their mechanical implications.
- Performance comparisons across different geometries (still under consideration).

## Students

This part of the project project was carried out by Vicente Millar-Bravo (`v.millarbravo@uandresbello.edu`) as part of the summer internships 2025 at the Millennium Institute SAPHIR.
